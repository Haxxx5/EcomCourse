*FOR LOOPS*
For loops in JS may have 3 inputs: 
For ("E1";"E2";"E3") 
where:
E1 is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.
E2 defines the condition for executing the code block.
E3 is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed.

*Data cells in JS*
In JS you have to define your data cells before using them.
In Script Mode if those data cells are not defined the program will fail

There are multiple ways to define data cells:

* var = an old definition that defines a global variable.
* let = scope variable, a variable that is defined only on a single program unit.
* const = a constant value that one cannot change

\\ As a mote: It is not recomanded to define global variables when working on a large bit of code//

*Boolien*
=== asks "strictly equals including the same type" of variable.
== asks equal but not neceserally of the same type.

5 == `5` true
5 === `5` false

\\ it is recomanded to use "strictly equals" more than just the equals//
